Brief Description about Project Implementation
The management of the attendance can be a great burden on the teachers if it is done
manually. To resolve this problem, smart and auto attendance management system is being
utilized. But authentication is an important issue in this system. The smart attendance
system is generally executed with the help of biometrics. Face recognition is one of the
biometric methods to improve this system. Being a prime feature of biometric verification,
facial recognition is being used enormously in several such applications, like video monitoring
and CCTV footage system, an interaction between computer humans and access systems
present indoors and network security. By utilizing this framework, the problem of proxies
and students being marked present even though they are not physically present can easily be
solved. This report proposes a model for implementing an automated attendance management system for students of a class by making use of face recognition technique and alerting
parents about the studentâ€™s presence with the help of a message alert system, parents will
also be able to visualize their kids overall attendance with the help of a dashboard. The
primary goal of this research was the practical employment of these state-of-the-art deep
learning approaches for face recognition tasks.
